					<h1>Ishan Kumar Verma</h1>
					<h2>QA AUTOMATION ENGINEER</h2>
					<p>With over 7 years of hands-on experience as Quality analyst in software testing, 
						I am deeply committed to upholding the quality standards of software products.
						My expertise spans manual testing, automation testing (using Selenium WebDriver, TestNG,
						and Cucumber), API testing (with tools like Postman and JMeter), database testing, and 
						performance testing. What drives me is the relentless pursuit of perfection and the 
						profound impact QA has on enhancing user experiences. From meticulously crafting test
						cases to orchestrating comprehensive test suites, I thrive on uncovering bugs and optimizing
						software performance. With each project, I'm fueled by the opportunity to 
						push the boundaries of quality assurance and deliver solutions that exceed customer expectations.

								<h2>About Me</h2>
								<div>Hi, my name is Paulina. Since the beginning of 2023 I have been studying and practicing to become a QA.
									I am happy to have finally found an area in which I can successfully develop myself. I hope that in the
									future I can become someone who professionally takes care of the quality of products and services. 
									Since I am learning Polish Sign Language, the subject of accessibility is particularly important to me.
									In the QA position I see the potential to make, at the very least, the digital world more welcoming for
									every person. In this portfolio, I would like to share my knowledge of QA and showcase my practical 
									skills that I have gained through courses and self-study. I am determined to continue to grow in this
									field. I have also recently started learning test automation in Python,
									so at the moment my main focus is on furthering my knowledge (and practice!) in this area.</div>
